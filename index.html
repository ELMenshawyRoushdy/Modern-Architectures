	<p align="left"> <font face="arial" size="5" color="white">Modern architecture or modernist architecture is a term applied to a 	group of styles of architecture which emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after 	World War II. It was based upon new technologies of construction, particularly the use of glass, steel and 	reinforced concrete; and upon a rejection of the traditional neoclassical architecture and Beaux-Arts styles that  were popular in the 19th century. Modern architecture continued a dominant architectural style for institutional 	and corporate buildings into the 21st century.</font>

	<p align="left"> <font face="arial" size="5" color="white">Modern architecture continued a dominant architectural style for 	institutional and corporate buildings into the 21st century. Modernism eventually generated reactions, most 	notably Postmodernism which sought to preserve pre-modern elements, while "Neo-modernism" has emerged as a 	reaction to Post-modernism.Notable architects important to the history and development of the modernist movement 	include Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Konstantin Melnikov, Erich 	Mendelsohn, Joseph Eichler, Richard Neutra, Louis Sullivan, Gerrit Rietveld, Bruno Taut, Gunnar Asplund, Arne 	Jacobsen, Oscar Niemeyer and Alvar Aalto.

	<p align="left"> <font face="arial" size="5" color="white">There are multiple lenses through which the evolution of modern architecture may be viewed. Some historians see it as a social matter, closely tied to the project of Modernity and thus the Enlightenment. Modern architecture developed, in their opinion, as a result of social and political revolutions. Others see Modern architecture as primarily driven by technological and engineering developments. Still other historians regard Modernism as a matter of taste, a reaction against eclecticism and the lavish stylistic excesses of Victorian and Edwardian architecture.
